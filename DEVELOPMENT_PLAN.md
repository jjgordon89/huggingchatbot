# Development Plan: Completing Profile and Settings Areas

This document outlines the plan to complete the identified areas for improvement within the Profile and Settings sections of the application, based on the current codebase analysis.

## 1. Account Settings and User Profile

*   **Goal:** Implement full user account and profile management, allowing users to register, log in, update their profile information, and potentially manage account security.

*   **Tasks:**
    *   Design and implement backend APIs for user registration, login, profile retrieval, profile updates (e.g., name, email, password), and account deletion.
    *   Integrate with a chosen authentication service (e.g., Firebase Authentication, Auth0) for secure user management.
    *   Create frontend components for user registration, login, and a detailed profile page.
    *   Add form validation and error handling for user input on registration, login, and profile update forms.
    *   Implement password reset and email verification flows.
    *   Consider adding multi-factor authentication (MFA) for enhanced security.
    *   Integrate the frontend with the backend APIs to display and update user profile information.
    *   Add options for users to manage their preferences (e.g., notification settings) within the profile.

*   **Dependencies:**
    *   **Authentication Service:** Installation of the chosen authentication library/SDK (`firebase`, `@auth0/auth0-react`, etc.). Creation and configuration of an application within the authentication provider's dashboard.
    *   **Backend Framework/Libraries:** Installation of necessary libraries for handling API requests, database interactions, and security (e.g., `body-parser`, database drivers like `pg`, ORMs like `sequelize` or `mongoose`, security libraries like `bcrypt`). Creation of new API routes and controllers.
    *   **Database:** Setup of a database (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, MySQL, etc.). Installation of a database driver or ORM. Creation of new tables or collections for user data.
    *   **Frontend Libraries:** Installation of form handling and validation libraries (`react-hook-form`, `yup`, `zod`). Creation of new React components for account-related pages.
    *   **Email Service (Optional):** Installation of an email sending library (`nodemailer`). Setup of an account with an email service provider (SendGrid, Mailgun).

## 2. Application Settings

*   **Goal:** Implement functional application settings for theme selection, interface density adjustment, and resetting settings to defaults.

*   **Tasks:**
    *   **App Theme:**
        *   Implement a theming system (using CSS variables or a theming library like `styled-components`, `@emotion/react`) to support light, dark, and system default themes.
        *   Store the user's selected theme preference (e.g., in local storage or user settings in the backend database).
        *   Apply the selected theme to the application's UI dynamically.
        *   Update the frontend select dropdown to accurately reflect and control the currently applied theme.
    *   **Interface Density:**
        *   Define CSS classes or styles to adjust spacing and sizing of UI elements for default, compact, and comfortable density levels.
        *   Store the user's selected density preference.
        *   Apply the appropriate CSS classes or styles based on the selected density.
        *   Update the frontend select dropdown to accurately reflect and control the currently applied density.
    *   **Reset All Settings:**
        *   Implement a function to reset all application settings (theme, density, potentially others added later) to their default values.
        *   Add a confirmation dialog to the frontend before performing the reset.
        *   Wire up the "Reset" button to trigger the reset function.

*   **Dependencies:**
    *   **Theming System:** Installation of a theming library if used. Creation of CSS variables or theme objects.
    *   **State Management (Optional but Recommended):** Installation of a state management library (Redux, Zustand, Jotai). Creation of state logic to manage settings globally.
    *   **Utility Functions:** Creation of utility functions to apply theme and density styles.
    *   **Frontend Components:** Modification of existing components to read and apply theme and density settings.

## 3. Vector Database Management

*   **Goal:** Implement features for monitoring and managing the vector database, providing insights into its status and allowing basic management operations.

*   **Tasks:**
    *   **Monitoring:**
        *   Develop backend endpoints to retrieve statistics about the vector database (e.g., number of vectors, index size, database size, potentially performance metrics).
        *   Create frontend components to display these statistics in a user-friendly way (e.g., tables, potentially charts if needed).
    *   **Management:**
        *   Implement backend APIs for basic management operations on the LanceDB instance (e.g., viewing connected tables/collections, getting schema information). Advanced index management (creating, deleting, rebuilding) could be a future enhancement.
        *   Consider adding functionality to view details of documents/vectors within the database.
        *   Create frontend components to interact with these management APIs and display the retrieved information.
    *   Enable the "Vector Database Management" button in the frontend and link it to the new management interface.

*   **Dependencies:**
    *   **Vector Database:** The LanceDB library (`@lancedb/lancedb`) is already a dependency. Ensure it's properly initialized and accessible.
    *   **Backend APIs:** Creation of new backend endpoints to interact with LanceDB.
    *   **Frontend Libraries:** Installation of libraries for data display (e.g., `chart.js` or `recharts` for charts, `@tanstack/react-table` for tables). Creation of new React components for the management interface.

## 4. Global Model Settings

*   **Goal:** Implement functionality to configure global model settings and preferences that can serve as defaults for the application.

*   **Tasks:**
    *   **Backend:**
        *   Design and implement backend APIs to store and retrieve global model settings (e.g., default model provider, default model name, default parameters like temperature, top_p, max_tokens).
        *   Consider adding validation for the stored model parameters.
    *   **Frontend:**
        *   Create frontend components to display and allow editing of the global model settings form.
        *   Use appropriate UI controls for different parameter types (e.g., dropdowns for model selection, sliders or input fields for numerical parameters, checkboxes for boolean options).
        *   Implement logic in the frontend to save the changes to the backend API.
        *   Add error handling and feedback for saving settings.
    *   **Model Usage Integration:**
        *   Modify the parts of the application where AI models are invoked to retrieve and utilize these global settings. Implement logic to allow workspace-specific or feature-specific settings to override global settings where applicable.
    *   Remove the placeholder message ("Global model settings will be available soon.") and display the functional settings interface.

*   **Dependencies:**
    *   **Backend APIs:** Creation of new backend endpoints and potentially database structures to store global model settings.
    *   **Frontend Libraries:** Utilization of existing form input components (`@/components/ui`).
    *   **API Integration:** Implementation of frontend logic to call the new backend APIs.
    *   **Model Usage Logic:** Modification of existing code that interacts with AI models.
